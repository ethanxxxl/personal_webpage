        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
        Hello and welcome to my website! Coming from the boondocks in Western Pennsylvania,
        I grew up with a passion for technology (ie, I'm a nerd). I started teaching myself programming when I was in
        middle school, an endeavor which continues to this day. During High School, I went to our local trade school
        and learned the basics of electrical engineering. I love the intersection of hardware and software,
        so much so that I decided to spend four years of my life studying actual engineering at Penn State.
        At Penn State, I am currently a Senior majoring in Electrical Engineering,
        with minors in Computer Engineering and Military Studies. Going to college also afforded me the opportunity to
        join the United States Air Force through AFROTC. I am slated to commission in May 2023 (Lord willing) as a 2nd Lt,
        hopefully as an Electrical Developmental Engineer (62EX)
        </p>
