        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
        Hello and welcome to my website! I grew up in Western Pennsylvania with
        a passion for technology. I started teaching myself programming when I
        was in middle school, an endeavor which continues to this day. During
        High School, I went to our local trade school and learned a little bit
        about electricity and circuits. I love the intersection of hardware and
        software, so much so that I decided to spend four years of my life at
        Penn State, studying Electrical Egineering, with a minor in Computer
        Engineering. I am currently a Senior, and am very excited to leave the
        education system (for a while at least). Going to college also afforded
        me the opportunity to join the United States Air Force through AFROTC. I
        am slated to commission in May 2023 (Lord willing) as a 2nd Lt, as an
        Electrical Developmental Engineer (62EX). I am told that I will be
        unecessary that I know <i>when</i> I will be moving, I am told that at
        some point, I will be moving to Wright Patterson AFB (Ohio) to work at
        NASIC (National Air and Space Intelligence Center). I had the pleasure
        of staying at WPAFB last summer for a month long "Advance Cyber
        Education" program, which was very fun.
